MODELO FRONTEND REACT TEST
==========================


To begin development environment:
1. Clone repo && cd into directory
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`
4. In another terminal window: `yarn test`
5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000

Bootstrapped quickly with create-react-app, in case you need to change any webpack configs.

### Task:

*Note: Try to keep under 1 hour on this task, global over local refactoring optimizations.*


This react app is a simple calculator.  Currently, it's functional (for the most part),
but obviously a bit rough around the edges.  Please refactor code to meet best practices, focusing
on code readability, reusability, and consistency.  Think whether any actions have
strange UX behavior.

Feel free to write in todos for tasks that would improve UX or reusability,
but would be outside the scope of this task time-wise.

Also, feel welcome to add in other libraries if they are part of your normal workflow.  Ideally,
link to the documentation for these libraries and leave a brief comment on why you added them in.

Testing may be helpful.
